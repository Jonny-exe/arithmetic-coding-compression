# arithmetic-coding-compression

This is an implementation (written in pythyon) of arithmetic coding for compression.

Note: this is not made for serious use

The results of this encoder are:

```
enwik4: 10k --> 7k
enwik5: 100k --> 63k
```

TODO:
  - Make it so you can compress folders
  - Make it work with files not encoded in utf-8
